# ai-05-self_project

In this project, I chose the dataset "Ch10Ex11.csv" from the website: https://www.statlearning.com/. This dataset contains 1000 gene expressions of 40 tissue samples with the first 20 samples are from healthy patients while the remaining are from the diseased. The dataset file, however, was generated as 40 columns and 1000 rows, therefore there is a need to make a transpose matrix from the original data file.

In this project, we will use clustering to check if hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering may correctly classify these samples into 2 groups as labeled. Naive Bayes Classifier (a supervised method) is also used to compare results with unsupervised learning models aforementioned. Finally, we will check which genes differ the most between 2 clusters by using loadings.
