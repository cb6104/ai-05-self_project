1,MachineLearning,"Project development presentation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spDbteQAlbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spDbteQAlbE)

This project aims to be particularly useful towards those, such as myself, who are interested in trading and investing in the stock market, but have little time to find or do their own research.

I am filtering out the most valuable posts from r/WallStreetBets by using supervised classification (naive-bayes) based on stock growths and text data in order to help any busy user quickly filter out what they want to read.

This is done in the goal of further democratizing stock trading by making the access to insightful stock research easier. Most people already know about the mainstream news outlets, this is why I chose this subreddit, where unique, unpopularized and insightful research are buried in a sea of quality memes.

**Usecase**

While digitalization is transforming our lives, 99% of musicians are still playing with physically printed scores. In contrast to printed books, this is not because they like them, they are quite a pain actually:

\- You must buy/print them and therefore you cannot just spontaneously try out a piece

\- If you play longer pieces you must interrupt your playing to flip the page or ask someone to do it for you

\- They often fall off or get blown away by the wind if you are outside

But sad truth is that there isn't really an alternative yet. Of course there are apps but there you must interrupt playing all the time to flip the page or preset a speed that is super-annoying, which is why musicians have always stuck to printed scores.

**Concept**

By flipping the pages via facial expression - e.g. by opening the mouth or turning the head rapidly (in the end there have to be several options to accommodate different instruments/preferences) - digital scores become super-handy and easy to use. All one needs is an app for smartphones and tablets that can recognize facial expressions via the front camera and flip the page. Building on that, one can implement lots of premium features (e.g. a pedal) to make the app profitable as well.

**Technical Solution**

I have already built a little Python prototype (--> video) with OpenCV facial landmarks where one flips pages by opening the mouth. Obviously, it's very vulnerable to changing light conditions and from what I could find out online, the process should be too tough on computing power for most smartphones/tablets. Therefore, I'm open to taking a different approach to the development of the actual product. One approach that came to my mind:

1. Take a dataset with e.g. 50 000 human faces and use Open CV (or something comparable) to label them according to the degree of mouth opened and later blinking/head turned etc. Label the ones where landmarks don't work manually and ideally check all the other ones as well.
2. Train a Neural Network on the labeled dataset \[assuming that running it later requires less computing power than landmarks\].
3. Implement the Neural Network in the mobile app. Assuming that Python wouldn't be efficient enough, I am thinking of PWA, for example, Xamarin or React Native.

**Context**

I'm myself a recent architecture graduate; therefore, my coding skills beyond Python and C# are slightly limited. I did the course on Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and did a few projects (like the prototype), still I wouldn't consider myself advanced in the field. Even worse, I haven't ever written a mobile app yet.

**I'm looking for**

1. Your feedback and your input - particularly on the Technical Solution.
2. **You**: I'd be more than happy to share this adventure; feel more than free to contact me!

Cheers,

Julian

5,MachineLearning,"Hello, all!

I wanted to ask the community whether there are any recent good papers that concern general credit fraud or perhaps even financial fraud in general that you'd recommend. I'm aware there's a lot of content based on the famous credit card fraud dataset, however, I'm more interested in credit fraud that doesn't concern that specific dataset. I'm also open to hearing about machine learning applications that could be considered/adapted for such modelling.

Please feel free to plug in your own research too. Thanks in advance!"
6,MachineLearning,"Although BERT became really popular after its release, it did have some limitations. And there were certain limitations associated with autoregressive methods like ELMo and GPT as well. XLNet was introduced to get the best of both worlds while at the same time not include their weaknesses.

In continuation of my Paper Notes series, I have written an informative summary of the paper. Personally, reading the XLNet paper was a very fun experience. I was amazed at every step, how they were including stuff to make the whole model work so well. The paper contained many interesting concepts that I had to give time to understand. So don't worry if you don't get it on the first go. Check out the links below and happy reading!

7,MachineLearning,"I am currently trying to implement a paper which involves K Nearest Neighbours with ""Large Margin Nearest Neighbour"" for distance metric learning to improve KNN's performance. I have checked out the paper ""Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification \[[https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume10/weinberger09a/weinberger09a.pdf](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume10/weinberger09a/weinberger09a.pdf)\]"" which had introduced the LMNN idea. While I am clear about the role of LMNN in KNN and other aspects, I am not clear about how the loss function for LMNN algorithm is optimized (authors have mentioned an algorithm for optimization but I am finding it complicated to understand). The project is actually an Android app (Java/Kotlin), so can't take advantage of the Python libs (also I would really like to learn the optimization algo so don't want to blindly use a lib too). So question is -- is anyone here aware of how the optimization works for LMNN or do you have any resources where this otpimization algo is explained in simpler way? Would really appreciate any help."
8,MachineLearning," Hello, i am an undergraduate student with a goal of getting into ML research and academia. Recently i was informed of the NAACL conference (which is conducted virtually) and it seems that i qualify for the Student fee which is 25$ however one must register for an ACL membership (for 50$) so in total it's 75$.

Im not cheap but to be honest im not financially doing very well currently, but if the benefits from attending the conference out weigh the costs for an aspiring researcher then i can register.

The question is, do the benefits out-weigh the costs?"
9,MachineLearning,"Recently Pytorch held an ecosystem day - event, that brings developers and practitioners together to share how they integrate their recent software/packages with Pytorch. Original post is [here](https://irregularadel.substack.com/p/highlights-of-pytorch-ecosystem-days).

[How one of the most popular DL frameworks builds the whole ecosystem of software and packages around itself.](https://preview.redd.it/7407gil77az61.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe591337b0ff229cf8d5eb8c56a231cfdcb736ab)

When I first saw it, I registered straight away. But boy, I must say, the schedule and organizational part disappointed me. The info and schedule were in Google docs (and yes, Google develops a direct competitor framework), it was big, overloaded, and hard to understand. In comparison, Google created a simple, easy to use and fancy [webpage](https://events.google.com/io/program/schedule?lng=en-US) with the schedule of their similar Google I/O event. As a Pytorch fan, I feel a bit ashamed.

Still, the event is full of content! It’s great that Pytorch and the Community support each other in better tools development.

To the content!

# Summary:

First of all, I see that products based on Pytorch are growing rapidly, and packages are becoming more and more domain-specific.

There are wrappers over PyTorch like Pytorch-lightning, Ignite, fastai, Catalyst - they meant to make high-level API with lots of SOTA features implemented.

The level of specification of pytorch ecosystem goes deeper each year - we now can find not only CV/NLP packages but also biomedical imaging, audio, time-series, reinforcement learning. 2D/3D Augmentation libraries, MLOps solutions. Some packages help to diagnose your models, like finding model drift, mitigate unfairness, compress them. I even saw a separate MLOps package for automated driving\*\*.\*\*

The whole ecosystem is [here](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/), and it quite interesting to dive into it. There are in total 60 (!) tools, libraries, and packages there. Soon, they will need an advanced filtering/categorization system. 

It is amazing, how fast this ecosystem grows, curious to see the next step of this evolution.

# Posters:

They are here - [https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/pted/2021](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/pted/2021)

I decided to start from the posters. and not from the videos, since imo posters are more interesting.

There are posters for such wide-known products like huggingface, pytorch lightning, etc. - I won’t mention them. Below is the list of something new/interesting that I personally want to mention.

by Dr. Thilo Hagendorff  


""Certain research strands can yield “forbidden knowledge”. This term refers to knowledge that is considered too sensitive, dangerous or taboo to be produced or shared. Discourses about such publication restrictions are already entrenched in scientifc felds like IT security, synthetic biology or nuclear physics research. This paper makes the case for transferring this discourse to machine learning research. Some machine learning applications can very easily be misused and unfold harmful consequences, for instance, with regard to generative video or text synthesis, personality analysis, behavior manipulation, software vulnerability detection and the like""

Arguably, this subreddit is also playing a role in this trend. Without being part of the traditional academic community, I feel like I have learned more about AI and ML without the need to do a Ph.D. or attend a conference. And I am deeply grateful this is possible. Thank you!

16,MachineLearning,"**Is there a mathematical model of the Mind?**

Please join us for a virtual Google workshop on “[Conceptual Understanding of Deep Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/conceptualdlworkshop/home)” 

**When**: May 17th 9am-4pm PST. 

**Where**: [Live over Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5DGBWjiULQ),

**Goal:** How does the Brain/Mind (perhaps even an artificial one) work at an algorithmic level? While deep learning has produced tremendous technological strides in recent decades, there is an unsettling feeling of a lack of “conceptual” understanding of why it works and to what extent it will work in the current form. The goal of the workshop is to bring together theorists and practitioners to develop an understanding of the right algorithmic view of deep learning, characterizing the class of functions that can be learned, coming up with the right learning architecture that may (provably) learn multiple functions, concepts and remember them over time as humans do, theoretical understanding of language, logic, RL, meta learning and lifelong learning.

The speakers and panelists include **Turing award** winners Geoffrey Hinton, Leslie Valiant, and Godel Prize winner Christos Papadimitriou, and experts from diverse backgrounds including, ML/AI, algorithms, theory, and neuroscience ([full-details](https://sites.google.com/view/conceptualdlworkshop/home)).

**Panel Discussion:** There will also be a panel discussion on the fundamental question of “**Is there a mathematical model for the Mind**?”. We will explore basic questions such as “Is there a provable algorithm that captures the essential capabilities of the mind?”, “How do we remember complex phenomena?”, “How is a knowledge graph created automatically?”, “How do we learn new concepts, function and action hierarchies over time?” and “Why do human decisions seem so interpretable?”

GANs have dominated the image generation space for the majority of the last decade. This paper shows for the first time, how a non-GAN model, a DDPM, can be improved to overtake GANs at standard evaluation metrics for image generation. The produced samples look amazing and other than GANs, the new model has a formal probabilistic foundation. Is there a future for GANs or are Diffusion Models going to overtake them for good?

How can I combine the auxiliary data with the image data ?
So naturally I can quantize the auxiliary data into a finite number of options and train a neural network for each dataset. But this is a poor option for many reasons, a main one is because I am using only a portion of the data for each network.

**Project:** [**https://free-view-video.github.io/**](https://free-view-video.github.io/)  
**Abstract**:  We present an algorithm for generating novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and any input time step given a monocular video of a dynamic scene. Our work builds upon recent advances in neural implicit representation and uses continuous and differentiable functions for modeling the time-varying structure and the appearance of the scene. We jointly train a time-invariant static NeRF and a time-varying dynamic NeRF, and learn how to blend the results in an unsupervised manner. However, learning this implicit function from a single video is highly ill-posed (with infinitely many solutions that match the input video). To resolve the ambiguity, we introduce regularization losses to encourage a more physically plausible solution. We show extensive quantitative and qualitative results of dynamic view synthesis from casually captured videos.

27,MachineLearning,"The idea of creating confidence intervals in regression models is quite straightforward. 

For example :
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Folorunso-Oludayo-Fasina/publication/284729754/figure/fig2/AS:300625800777756@1448686184816/Scatter-plot-with-linear-regression-fit-and-a-95-confidence-interval-for-reported.png

But do confidence intervals carry over to classification models?

1) For example, in this picture here (confidence interval for an ROC curve corresponding to a classification model ) https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7KSNm.png - can the lower limit of the confidence interval from this ROC curve be used to gauge how well this model might generalize to new data?

2) For a classification model, can we make a confidence interval for the prediction of an individual observation? For instance, I wrote some R code (you can directly copy/paste the code) for a particular example where a random forest (i.e. classification model) is used to predict whether if an observation will be ""approved"" or ""rejected"" (see here for the code: https://shrib.com/#Madelyn_NMjYE8) .

Thus, for each observation, the classification model predicts the probability that this observation will be ""approved"" or ""rejected"". Whichever probability is higher, the model selects that outcome for the given observation.

Also, the higher one of these probabilities are, this means the classification model is more confident with its prediction (e.g. for two observations, the ratio of approved:rejected 0.9:0.1 vs 0.6:0.4 . The model is more confident about the first prediction)

Thus, is there anyway to apply the notion of confidence intervals to the probabilities for individual predictions?

28,MachineLearning,"Hi guys,

I'd like to ask the community for a problem I am trying to solve at the workplace.

We have a client that owns a series of restaurants over the territory. Every week, these restaurants receive food deliveries and our client keeps track of how much food is given to them vs how much it is sold.

The idea is simple: he uses an in-house algorithm that tunes the number of items a specific restaurant should receive for the week so that the number of unsold items doesn't (hopefully) go under a ""dangerous"" threshold. If the restaurant consistently sells most of the food it receives, the algorithm flags it as consistent and keeps on sending a similar number of food pieces every week. Otherwise, the number of deliveries is reduced to attempt to balance the number of unsold items.

This has worked quite well for the client, but he has asked me and my team to improve this process.

He has sent us data from a single restaurant that holds data from the beginning of 2021. The columns are the following -> restaurant\_id, date, type (delivered / sold), quantity, food\_description.

Do you have any ideas on how this problem can be tackled? I was thinking of linear regression and to use the number of sold items as my X to predict the y, which would be the number of items to deliver. I still don't know if this makes sense, so I am asking around for some ideas.

Thank you,"

I've come across this paper -- Recipe1M+: A Dataset for Learning Cross-Modal Embeddings for Cooking Recipes and Food Images where the main task is trainingg a neural network to learn a joint embedding of recipes and images that yields impressive results on an image-recipe retrieval task. 

It also has an image to recipe retrieval where theye evaluate all the recipe representations for im2recipe retrieval. Given a food image, the task is to retrieve its recipe from a collection of test recipes.

It also includes some embedding properties like word2vec.

They basically use CNN for encoding the image and RNNs to encode both the recipe and the instructions and then have a joint embedding for the recipe and instructions. Their embedding is created using a cosine Similarity loss and one semantic regularization loss.

For introduction of RL to image captioning, I've seen the they incorporated RL by having their Deep Q Network to learn through action - the next word of the imagecaption, state (the current words on the caption on time t) and reward being some score.

I was wondering how do I introduce Deep RL for this scenario on embeddings. Hopefully you can help guide me."

>In this paper about improving latent space inversion for a pretrained StyleGAN2 generator the authors propose to model the output of the mapping network as a Gaussian, which can be expressed as a mean and a covariance matrix. This prior is used to regularize images that are projected into latent space  via optimization, which makes the inverted images lie in well conditioned regions of the generator's latent space, and allows for smoother interpolations and better editing.

43,MachineLearning,"I have been submitting to top medical imaging conferences (miccai and isbi), I feel like half of the reviewers either didn’t thoroughly read the paper or they were just not familiar with the topics or the conference requirements. I heard reviewers at other conferences are pretty noisy as well, so I’m wondering how we can improve the quality of the reviews. I’m gonna provide a few examples from my personal experience 

1. A paper of mine was accepted as ISBI and there were 2 reviewers. One of them thought my methods could do a lot of things that it was not capable of. I feel like they didn’t understand my method and just thought my results looked cool, since it’s pretty easy to see the limitations of my algorithm. The other reviewer obviously didn’t read my paper carefully either. I explicitly explained that the only thing I had in common with a competing previous work was that we both used a graph representation, but the actual methods were completely different. I literally spent most of the introduction explaining this. Then that reviewer claimed my method was not much different from the previous one. 

2. This paper were rejected at miccai. While the reviewers’ concern were valid and they wanted to see more experiments, it was only a 8-page single-column paper. There was no way I could fit all the ablation studies in there. I have already included 3 experiments that were both quantitative and qualitative. Also, a reviewer had a really weird comment regarding this paper. I was using a hierarchical conditional VAE, and the reviewer said the difference between my method and the original VAE was not clear.

3. I’m not sure if this is a misunderstanding but a reviewer straight up said my results were suspicious because the numbers kind of counter intuitive at first glance. I might need to analyze the results more but I thought the claim was kind of rude."
44,MachineLearning,"During pretraining of BERT, two sentences A and B are given, transformed using WordPiece- and position embeddings, and are made distinct from each other by including two extra features into the input:

- The [SEP] token, which is inserted between sentence A and B,
- The predefined Segment Embeddings, which are added to the the embedding layer.

 What I cant figure out is, why are both of these included? Shouldn't either one by themselves do the job?

The [SEP] token in particular seems redundant to me, as it isn't even used for the Next-Sentence  Prediction pretraining task which instead trains on the [CLS], if I've understood everything correctly."

Very interesting & insightful article: ""Why Are We Using Black Box Models in AI When We Don’t Need To? A Lesson From An Explainable AI Competition""

by Cynthia Rudin and Joanna Radin

""In 2018, a landmark challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) took place, namely, the Explainable Machine Learning Challenge. The goal of the competition was to create a complicated black box model for the dataset and explain how it worked. One team did not follow the rules. Instead of sending in a black box, they created a model that was fully interpretable. This leads to the question of whether the real world of machine learning is similar to the Explainable Machine Learning Challenge, where black-box models are used even when they are not needed. We discuss this team’s thought processes during the competition and their implications, which reach far beyond the competition itself. ""

What if we want to extract and summarize text from documents, also handle translation, combine the   outputs and load it into an Embeddings index. Enter workflows! The demo above takes a list of GitHub project pages, extracts text from HTML, summarizes the text and builds a similarity search index. This same concept could be applied towards a list of company pages, wikipedia pages and more. This is just one example of what txtai workflows can do.

txtai workflows are a simple yet powerful construct that takes a callable and returns elements. Workflows are streaming by nature and work on data in batches, allowing large volumes of data to be processed efficiently. The amount of functionality provided by machine learning models continues to grow rapidly. txtai provides an easy way to interface with these models. The following is a non-comprehensive list.

\- Questions - Extractive question-answering using a text context  
\- Labels - Apply labels to text using a zero-shot classification model  
\- Summary - Abstractive text summarization  
\- Text Extraction - Extract text from documents  
\- Transcription - Transcribe audio to text  
\- Translation - Machine translation

Workflows  allows joining these models together to create powerful data transformations. Workflows can also be constructed in JavaScript, Go, Rust and Java via the API.

50,MachineLearning," TLDR: For training from scratch on non-classification tasks with humble computation resources, are ResNets roughly as good as it gets? This has been my experience, although the literature (and the hype surrounding it) does not seem to agree with me at all. Please prove me wrong.

In the past years visual models have transitioned from ResNets to EfficientNets (and more recently Vision Transformers), and temporal/sequence models have transitioned from RNNs to Transformers. While the latter, in my experience, constitute a clear step forward for almost all aplications and resource-scenarios, the former, in my experience, has never really worked for me.

While I'm well aware that pre-trained efficientnets perform extremely well on ImageNet, and are quite successful for finetuning on other classification tasks, and even segmentation, for me they have never worked well for new tasks such as generation from visual features, or self-supervised learning. I have seen some threads about this here and there, but it does not seem to make a dent on the efficientnet hype overall.

There are also other models, such as RegNets and Vision Transformers, but these are still substantially slower during training time than normal ResNets without massive performance improvements (in fact, for vision transformers, this underwhelming behaviour was acknowledged in the recent DINO paper). So basically I am left with the questions: 1. are ResNets roughly as good as it gets?, or 2. Have I not found the good new visual models? or 3. Has my extensive experimentation with these new models led to misleading conclusions?

The fact that very recent self-supervised learning literature is still focused on ResNets (excluding very recent SSL vision transformer works), and that most practicioners I know that do not work strictly with classification still use ResNets, leads me to believe that perhaps there is something to this, and I am not totally deluded. Please prove me wrong. Cheers."

The reason for using ML and not some bruce force approach is that the ML optimizer can learn which kind of functions better respect the constraints by trial and error and eventually finding the way, but that's just an idea. Maybe ML can't even be used.

I tried to search something in literature but I couldn't find anything. Could you help me out a little, at least for knowing what to look for? Thank you in advance!

EDIT: To be more specific, I have a function f(k,n) that, with fixed k=k0 and varying n (discrete), is something like a bell. Now the problem is that, when k0 increases, the bell width of f(k0,n) increases too. However, instead of f(k,n), I'm allowed to use f(g(k),n), where g(k) is polynomial in k. Now the question is: how can I find the best g(k) such that, when increasing k0, I have that f(g(k0),n) has a constant-width bell? (Let's assume that the width is the number of points on the n axis inside the bell)"

Terminology

1. Professor = CEO
2. PhD student/Postdocs = Program/Product Manager
3. Master's/Batchelor's students = Code Monkeys, Independent contractors, Unpaid Interns
4. Paper = Product
5. Publishing Paper in big venue = Product release
6. NSF/Amazon/Google/Facebook/Jeffery Epstein/Other Funding Souces = VC Funds. 

Life Cycle of A Product:  

1. CEO thinks of some company vision and hires some program managers. Sells the vision of a product as equity to some dreamy-eyed employees who become the code monkeys.  
2. CEO parallelly makes different code monkeys work on same vision while program managers are chilling. 
3. One code monkey from the army comes up with some new neural lego that works after months. CEO becomes super happy with the outcomes of the lego. Other code monkeys are told to keep working on a problem when there is already a working solution that even they can know. 
4. CEO tells winning code monkey lets make a product out of the lego. Step In Project Managers. No clue of how the lego was built, start dictating how to productize it. 
   1. Winning Code Monkey asks to give spec on what is needed for product release, Project manager gives some requirements. Code monkey satisfies requirements. One week later project manager changes the requirement. The pattern keeps repeating and code monkey keeps getting frustrated. 
5. Winning code Monkey keeps working on the product but CEO and project manager all have their visions on how to sell it.  Winning code Monkey asks for code and detailed information to run lego along with all results be fully open-sourced with the product. CEO and project manager tell the winning code monkey to fuck off because exposing too much information is not good for the product. 
6. On product release, the CEO goes to VC funds for more money to hire more project managers. 
   1. If multiple products succeed, Bask in VC Money.  If fail, no more funds and no more project managers. 
7. On product release, winning code monkey's contract is done and the project manager takes over the product, and post-release the product is shelved because it helped get new funding for the new project managers. Other code monkeys hopelessly play with neural lego dreaming of hopefully productizing one day with some other new vision of the CEO. 

Code monkey very upset that the code got no value in this product space. Code monkey also upset that working with many monkeys in an AGILE way could have made the product much faster but Program managers and CEO didn't like that too much as equity sharing on product becomes the issue.  

But what do I know. I am just a code monkey with a tiny tiny product experience."
55,MachineLearning,"When we talk about ML models' accuracy and other metrics, nobody cares whether they are better than random or not (I am exaggerating a little bit). What people care about is whether the model is *better* than humans' performance.

For some reason, this doesn't seem to be the case for bias and fairness. Whenever people talk about controversial potential algorithms (for instance, AI immigration officers or AI hiring such as HireVue) people get very defensive and say that the algorithms are going to be biased. Of course! 

But are they going to be *more* biased than humans? I highly doubt that. I bet an AI  wouldn't ask me to open my luggage so frequently after I land in London just because I have a beard and am not too white.

In any case, I don't understand why the baseline for fairness/bias for AI algorithms is zero and not human performance. 

Now, I recognize that the expectation of AI from users (e.g. interviewees from HireVue) are much higher than of humans and they might also feel more uncomfortable. So, yes, I do see why we want a fairer/less biased AI than humans but the conversation needs to go deeper than this.

There are costs and benefits to introducing AI -- if it's more accurate than humans, less biased than humans and cheaper than humans, chances are it should be used.

My point is simply saying ""AI is biased"" and putting a period, in my opinion, is not the right way to go about it. A Human is also biased and, in many cases, significantly more biased than the AI."

Recovering badly damaged face images is a useful yet challenging task, especially in extreme cases where the masked or damaged region is very large. One of the major challenges is the ability of the system to generalize on faces outside the training dataset. We propose to tackle this extreme inpainting task with a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes structural information, such as edges, as a prior condition. Edge information can be obtained from the partially masked image and a structurally similar image or a hand drawing. In our proposed conditional GAN, we pass the conditional input in every layer of the encoder while maintaining consistency in the distributions between the learned weights and the incoming conditional input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with badly damaged face examples.

This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which way. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to these questions. For selected approaches, we describe the main ideas in more detail."

78,MachineLearning,"I'll start with a very simple example.

Let's say I want to compute something similar to exponential moving average of time-series data, but with only N previous input values being averaged. I can make a vector of exponentially decaying weights and compute dot product of this vector and N previous inputs, getting the result I want. 

But of course it's inefficient and for large enough N it doesn't give much of a difference from a standard exponential moving average, computed using feedback. So I can just use EMA as a good approximation of my desired result. In some sense, I approximated a large memoryless linear system using a small linear system with memory.

I was wondering about a more general version of this idea: What if my weights were different, but with magnitudes still decaying ~exponentially, and I was only interested in approximation being ""good"" on a small subset of possible inputs. An example of this could be an artificial reverberation, which also works by taking a large weighted average of shifted copies of an audio signal. 

To me, this seems similar to the way RNNs work (i.e. taking advantage of internal state and restricted input space to find a good approximation of a non-trivial transform of time-series data), but since they're typically nonlinear I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use them here. On the other hand, I couldn't find much information on RNNs with purely linear activation functions.

Has anybody here seen something similar to this? Are there issues or complications that I'm missing?

79,MachineLearning,"In the case of data being not so big, the AUC can be relatively random. That is why in this kind of cases you want to do cross validation and average the out-of-fold AUCs to have something close to the real one.

However in order to have an idea of how accurate this AUC is, it would be best to have a p-value for it. I did research and learned interesting things. One way would be to use boostrapping and it should work not too bad, however best would be to use actual stats, like you can find here:

It comes in a couple of aggregation flavors - by census tract ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_censustract#summary ), where the region name is the census tract id, and by postal code ( https://gourdian.net/g/eric/sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code#summary ), where the name is the postal code.

Now you can make use of your AWS credits to get a Colab-like experience (or dare I say, better than Colab, because we do all the setup for you).

91,MachineLearning,"I'm interested in techniques to prime the end sequence of a transformer and am wondering if anyone knows of any papers or has suggestions on the best way to do this.

Here's what I mean by end priming: Let's say we're training a generative language model and want to generate a sequence which ends with ""straw.""

So, ""That's the last straw."" and ""That's the final straw."" might be valid completions that the network could give us.

I've tried two techniques so far and haven't had good results with either:

Technique 1: Alter the attention mask such that all time points can access the last N tokens (with N being the length of the primer). This approach results in training instability (the loss starts to oscillate widely after a certain point in training). So I modified it further such that I do ""crop"" the loss and do not include the last N tokens in its computation. This, too, is unstable and I've had to reduce the learning rate further but have still gotten poor results.

Technique 2: Place the primer at the start of the sequence (while leaving the attention mask alone -- i.e. each time point can only see itself and the past time points). For example, I'd want the model to output something like ""straw. This is the last"" Technique 2 also results in learning instabilities. When I reduce the learning rate low enough to avoid them, I'm left with convergence to a poorly performing model.

I'm able to train vanilla transformers just fine, so I believe it's unlikely there are problems elsewhere in my pipeline."
92,deeplearning,"Although BERT became really popular after its release, it did have some limitations. And there were certain limitations associated with autoregressive methods like ELMo and GPT as well. XLNet was introduced to get the best of both worlds while at the same time not include their weaknesses.

In continuation of my Paper Notes series, I have written an informative summary of the paper. Personally, reading the XLNet paper was a very fun experience. I was amazed at every step, how they were including stuff to make the whole model work so well. The paper contained many interesting concepts that I had to give time to understand.

This could be one of the reasons for the gap. 

I later saved the weights and tested on one of the validation sets separately. And now the accuracy changes for every run. I then had to set a seed to stabilize the accuracy, which is now 61%. Shouldn't it be the same as seen while training? I don't see why I had to set a seed while testing."

Most examples that I have seen for this implementation either really simplify it by using a one-channel input and a single one-channel filter, or just dive straight into the Mathematics which doesn't only not help but also confuses me more.

>In this paper about improving latent space inversion for a pretrained StyleGAN2 generator the authors propose to model the output of the mapping network as a Gaussian, which can be expressed as a mean and a covariance matrix. This prior is used to regularize images that are projected into latent space via optimization, which makes the inverted images lie in well conditioned regions of the generator's latent space, and allows for smoother interpolations and better editing.

Today's post is about Generative and Discriminative Models  
In machine learning and deep learning, we often create these two different kinds of models for solving problems.  


Discriminative Models: These kinds of models focus on differences between classes to solve a problem. For example, a classifier built to classify dogs and cats is a discriminative model that learns the differences between a dog and a cat.  


Generative Models: A generative model tries to learn the appearance of the classes. For example, a generative model may be used to create a realistic picture of a dog.  


You will also get a foundational understanding of generative models.

110,deeplearning,"I considered posting this to r/PhD, but ultimately decided that here was more relevant.

In short, I am a 2nd year PhD student looking to get a good industry job once I graduate. My lab is in the biomed engineering department and focuses on deep learning applied to medical imaging, but I am part of the electrical engineering dept. All of my experience in DL has come from my graduate courses in the past 2 years, which have all been math-heavy, and in that time, I've thought that I might be more interested in more general deep learning/computer vision research or deep learning for something like robotics, but I don't know if deviating from my lab would be wise.

My advisor's awesome and well established in his field, and I don't see myself switching labs (funding is also not an issue). He's pretty hands-off and gives me latitude to pursue my interests, but if I research something outside the lab's scope, then I'm not really leveraging any of the resources, network, or past knowledge that's here, which somewhat eliminates the purpose of being in a lab. Additionally, I'd be competing against researchers in their fields, who do have all of these resources. Also, while I think that I may be more interested general DL/CV or applied robotics, this could honestly be 'grass is greener' syndrome, where I automatically see fields that I know less about as comparatively more interesting and lucrative.

Overall, my options are to stick with my lab's direction, completely deviate and do my own thing, or somehow try and find something in between. My current goal is to get a lucrative and interesting job doing research in industry, but I don't have a good sense of how the PhD market for theoretical/applied DL fields really works/is. Is it common, or even possible for PhD students to study one application, but then ultimately land jobs in different applications that have some common principles?"

134,deeplearning,"One of the most common pruning techniques is ""unstructured, iterative, global magnitude pruning"" which prunes smallest magnitude p% of weights in each iterative pruning round. 'p' is typically between (10-20)%. However, after the desired sparsity is reached, say 96% (meaning that 96% of the weights in the neural network is 0), how can I remove these 0s to essentially remove say filters/neurons?

Because this pruning technique produces a lot of 0s which still participate in forward propagation using *out = W.out\_prev + b.* Therefore, this pruning technique will help in compression but not in the reduction of inference time.

**Key takeaway:** Change the first conv layer to have the hyper-parameters kernel\_size = (3, 3), stride = (1, 1) and padding = (1, 1) instead of the original ones since CIFAR-10 dataset has much smaller images and using the original conv layer hyper-parameters reduces the image size due to which the resulting model performs not so good, according to my experiments.

I'm a PhD student and I've got some funding to put together a machine for ML/DL. My lab currently has a pretty powerful machine....or at least it was pretty powerful about 10 years ago.

* 256GB RAM (I'm going to assume DDR3) - I'm not actually in the lab to check.
* Quatro FX 5800

159,deeplearning,"Hey everyone,

A friend and I developed [Nimbo](https://nimbo.sh), a dead-simple CLI that wraps the AWS CLI, allowing you to run code on AWS as if you were running it locally. You can find the source code here ([https://github.com/nimbo-sh/nimbo](https://github.com/nimbo-sh/nimbo)) and the docs here ([https://docs.nimbo.sh](https://docs.nimbo.sh/)).

We decided to build this because we were frustrated with how cumbersome using AWS was, and we just wanted to be able to run jobs on AWS as easily as we run them locally. At the same time, we wanted to make use of the cheap spot instances (on Nimbo, this is a single parameter). All in all, we didn't like the current user experience of working with AWS, and we believed it was possible to vastly improve it.

For this reason, we also provide many useful commands to make it faster and easier to work with AWS, such as launching notebooks on EC2, easily checking prices, logging onto an instance, or syncing data to/from S3 (you can see some useful commands at [https://docs.nimbo.sh/useful-commands](https://docs.nimbo.sh/useful-commands)).

Unlike other similar services, we are solely client-side, meaning that the code runs on your EC2 instances and data is stored in your S3 buckets (we don't have a server; all the infrastructure orchestration happens in the Nimbo package). We are also open contribution, meaning that all the source code is publicly available on our GitHub, and we welcome community contribution.

We have tons of ideas for Nimbo, like adding docker support, and providing instances with preloaded datasets like ImageNet, so that you don't have to download and store it yourself - you simply spin the instance, and the dataset is available at /datasets. We are currently working on adding GCP support, so that you can use AWS or GCP with the same config file.

We are happy to receive any feedback and suggestions you have."

Hi, i’m working on a university project in wich we try to analyze the news published in online media. For this end we’ve use [Capture a Website screenshot](https://www.site-shot.com/) to take a screenshot of every news published by several websites, but as you can see the “screenshot” takes the whole website, not only the news, so  when we transform that .jpg file to a .pdf and then to a .docx file, we get a lot of information we don’t actually need.

There are several “patterns” (the headline and the “comment” section or the author name for example) that tipycally signall the start and endpoint of the news, so i though if there is a software that automatically recognize this “patterns” and then batch cut all the images (there must be something like 5.000 by now) that would save us a lot of work.

I've add a cropped and uncropped .jpg as example of what we expect to achieve. Thank you very much!

I wonder whether there is a video format, that allows me to store videos in a compact/compressed way.

My videos have between 1-2 hours of length and consist of very repeative frames/tiles.

To be more exact:
I am screenrecording certain webinars in 1920x1080, which show my prof (in a 180x 120px frame) and the rest is been used by a powerpoint presentation of around 20 slides.
So in opinion the most compressive way would be to store the mentioned 180x120px separately and to overlay these of around 20 pictures of the mentioned slides.

(to be honest: These 20 pictures is just mentioned to illustrate the application. As he is sometimes drawing on the power point slides, there are some more pictures to take. There is also the windows time bar in the bottom border, showing the current time - so another tile which is been modified 120x in two hours)

Is there a format allowing this application/such kind of compression?

Which format is been used by observation cams? They’re are also recording more or less the same picture the whole time, which is just modified by passing animals, passing people, the motion of trees in the wind or from the moving sun.

But I'm not looking for the most similar pixels, I'm looking for the few images that are most different, especially in a particular part of the frame where a bird obscures the moon. The statistically most different frames, post alignment.

While advising users to supply images of optimal size and aspect ratio, invariably some photos may be displayed with the correct height but not the proper width or -- vice versa. 

Is there a digital tool in the form of an SDK or API that can extend the edge of an image via a technique like a Gaussian blur? I see something like this approach being used when TV journalists must make a vertical cell phone video more aesthetically fit the broadcast screen.

I'm trying to solve the following problem:

I've taken a burst shot on my DSLR camera of me making a dribble and dunking the basketball, and it consists of 8 photos. Using OpenCV and python, I am trying to combine all those photos together. I have tried doing the alpha blending addition of the images, but the combined novel image gets too transparent. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach this?

201,imageprocessing," 

I graduated this December with an EE degree and have been running into a series of brick walls trying to get into image processing as a career. Sadly only in the last year of my college was I able to take an image processing course and only then did I find how much I actually enjoy it.

&#x200B;

Out of school I applied to several places and after about three weeks actually got an interview with Lockheed Martin where they offered me the job to work on missiles using image processing. They even wanted to get me certified in radiology. The job was super cool but the location turned me off. Thinking this was just the start of many great things I turned down their offer. How stupid I was. I have almost reached a breaking point in my search after 4+ months. I have had pros look over my resume, I am going to networking groups, I have tried career fairs, and I am going through every job board every day just to find something and nothing seems to help.

&#x200B;

Every job board will have maybe 20 hits on the search ""image processing"" or ""Matlab"" of those 20, 10 might be applicable to actual image processing and not something totally unrelated (or sponsored and completely unrelated, thanks Indeed), of those 10, 1 might not require 6+ years experience, require being a post doctoral fellow, or other credentials. Networking groups are just filled with old people who think I am an electrician and have no idea what I have done or want to do. Only one career fair has actually been a career fair and that was for my college, the other 3 I have gone to are nothing but ""get a job as a cop"" or ""food service"" or disguised college recruiting events. The worse part is the next career fair for my college isn't even till September. Even my back up plan of just looking for EE jobs results in the same thing, hundreds of hits, 30% are applicable (If I ever meet someone IRL that calls themselves a ""hotel engineer"" I will strangle them) , 90% of that 30% call themselves ""entry level"" but require 6+ years and special software and such, and the remaining are field engineer jobs and FPGA design jobs.

&#x200B;

I am genuinely starting to break down and my mental health is beginning to take a hit. Every day I get up and all I see is rejection email after rejection email. Even after 4 months and literally hundreds of applications I have only gotten like 5 interviews, 1 from Lockheed where they offered me the job, 3 phone/skype/webcam, and 1 from Raytheon where they flew me to Texas just to tear me a new asshole and tell me everything I have ever done is worthless in the field of EE.

&#x200B;

I tried recently to talk to my professor from school but all he did was tell me that image processing is great, but DEEP LEARNING with an image processing background, is the future and said I should look into that. Welp... I learned some, even watched all of a Stanford course on it on YouTube and did all the lessons. Well guess what the results are when you type that into a job board and what do you get? 70% non-applicable ->90% of the 30 want 6+ years and specialized software.

&#x200B;

Please can someone help identify what I am doing wrong? I just want a job doing something I remotely enjoy. It's almost daily I don't think about that job I didn't take and contemplate hanging myself. It has to be me right? Supposedly the job numbers are insanely good right now."

I'm realizing that ""edge effect"" might be a ubiquitous issue in the image processing professional's daily life and wanted to ask about the common ways you deal with it. For clarification, I am talking about the phenomenon where when moving a kernel across a matrix, the outer rows and columns of pixels of the image will either have to be estimated or not given at all. How big of an issue is this for image processing professionals? What kind of methods or algorithmic tricks do you use to get around this?

I am curious because I am hoping to split a large image into smaller tiles, and will try to experiment with various algorithms that ""borrow"" values from adjacent pixels.

He was riding his bike downhill when a car driving in the opposite direction took a left, hitting Ariel and smashing his bike. Ariel was injured badly and taken to hospital.

We have several cameras documenting the car from different angles - several from a bus that drove just past the car and filmed it from the front and the back (as the car drove past the bus), as well as one camera (a Nest) from a window of a neighbor. In all, there are dozens of frames across videos that capture the license plate itself, but none of them has the resolution to show the license plate number. 

I know there are super-resolution methods that rely on a plurality of (blurry) frames to create a higher resolution image. There may be other methods I'm not aware of. I don't have the technical ability unfortunately to do this enhancement of resolution. (I am an engineer with some background in signal processing - but my days at the university were 15 years ago...)

We know the make and model of the car, as well as the demographics of the driver and a general idea of where he lives. Even if we're able to uncover one character from the license plate - that will go a long way for the police to be able to narrow down their search and reach him.

232,imageprocessing,"Hey there,
I am currently working on the problem of Image Registration and implementing feature based registration based on HOG in OpenCV(python). The process involves three steps
1. Keypoints extraction(done using FAST algorithm)
2. Feature Description(HOG)
3. Feature Matching
I am a newbie in the field of Image processing and want to compare the HOG vectors for feature matching. I tried using the cdist() method in openCV but it results into memory error. I also tried the inbuilt method of brute force matching but it seems it doesn’t work for HOG descriptors and only worrks for multidimensional descriptors like sift and surf.
Can someone suggest a good method to proceed to feature matching stage?
Thank you."

# Data Analysis' Best of 2020

Like many other subreddits that are winding up 2020, /r/dataanalysis will be participating in [Reddit's **Best of 2020** event](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2020/). And now that 2020 is on the verge of being history, we are looking for you to nominate the best submissions and comments made throughout the year. 

# Added Motivation

A lot of these ""Best of"" contests have relatively low participation. So to ensure that doesn't happen here, we're adding an extra element:

* Those who offer nominations will themselves be included in a draw for additional Reddit award prizes. 
* For each nomination a user offers, up to a maximum of 10 (you can of course nominate more!), that user's name will be included as an entry in the draw. 

There will be more than 1 award to be distributed, provided that we have at least 50 entries.

# Categories

Since lots of members just comment, there are some categories which are exclusive for comments, others are exlusive for post, and some apply to both comments and posts.

* Best Career Question (Post)
* Best Technical Question (Post)
* Best Guide / How-To (Either)
* Best Technical Answer (Comment)
* Best Career Advice (Comment)
* Best Career Advice (Post)
* Best Data Visualization (Either)
* Best Resource (Either)
* Funniest (Either)

# Voting Method

* The thread here is where you nominate. Each of the comments below is a category. 
* For each submission you want to nominate, 
  1. Reply to the top level comment under the relevant category with a direct link to the post
  2. Include the username of the nominee  
  3. Give a 1 or 2 point explanation of why you want to nominate that one, *for that category*, e.g. ""Great explanation of how SQL works!""
* To vote on the best nomination for each category, simply upvote the nomination comments you believe most deserving! No downvoting, please.
* If the nomination does not fit the category, it may be removed in accordance with mod judgement.

# Deadline

* Submissions & voting need to be complete by January 9, 23:59 PST. 


# Other Rules

* The post or comment must have been made in 2020 (the 366 days since preceeding this post!) and not edited after the time of this post.
* You can nominate posts by anyone but yourself.
* If you nominate multiple posts by others (and you should!!), you shouldn't nominate the same redditor more than once.
* Every nomination must not be in violation of Reddit's rules nor /r/dataanalysis' rules (see sidebar)
* Comments cannot be nominated for multiple qualifying categories.
* Comments by anyone who participated as a Mod here during 2020 is ineligible to participate.
* At genuine least 5 nominations, by 5 separate users are needed in a category in order for that category to be eligible. 
* If the top 2 to 3 nominations within a category have scores within 20% of the maximum, the prize may be split or selected from the top 2 to 3 at random.
* Don't make a duplicate nomination. 
* Finally, there will be an announcement thread for the winners. The winners need to reply in that thread *before the end of January 2021* in order to receive a prize.

I am a junior in High School and part of my program is to work with a researcher to do a project. My lab moved virtual this year and this caused me to be working with coding instead of hands on lab work which is what I ""signed up for"". Basically Ive been able to slack all year and my mentor is a little flakey which has further allowed me to avoid doing any and all work. I realize that this is my own fault and instead of starting my project a day before I need to finish Im starting a month before. Yay! The problem here being that I was given instruction at the beginning of the school year and idiot me did not write down or record them leaving myself with small clues about what I am actually supposed to be doing. Now I am supposed to have learned R, which I have not done, and I have a paper titled, ""Comprehensive characterization of plasma cell-free *Echinococcus* spp. DNA in echinococcosis patients using ultra-high- throughput sequencing"" as well as the data that was used in this paper. I am supposed to be analyzing this data but I honestly don't know what I am supposed to be looking for. I have one page of notes where I wrote, ""find motifs"", ""we predict from this gene..."", and ""will show in Serem""

I thought that I would bring this mess to reddit in the hopes that some random person might know exactly what I was talking about and would be able to help. If you have any ideas of another sub this would help in I would greatly appreciate it, and any and all resources would help.

241,dataanalysis,"Hey everyone!

I graduated from college last December and am 2 months in to my first ""real"" job. It's not a data analysis position, but I have already done a couple of projects that I think relate to data science. For example, I work at a data center and I created an excel doc that visualizes connections between UPSs and PDUs, and used a ton of formulas to create the ability to see what would happen/how power would redistribute if a UPS went down. 

I found that I actually really enjoyed that project: treating it like a puzzle, learning about how to use excel on a much more complicated level than I'd ever done before, and getting immense satisfaction when I completed it and turned it in to my boss. 

So my question is: what are some steps I can take (that don't involve going back to college or getting a different job) so I can explore and see if data analysis really is something I want to do? I do have access to LinkedinLearning (aka Lynda).

242,dataanalysis,"Hi, I'm currently working in the data migration field (mainly with VBA) and are working towards becoming a data analyst. 

I'm aware of what skills are required for data analysis, but my current manager has asked me to learn Javascript. 

My question is: is there much of a need for this language in the data analysis profession? I'm just wondering how deep I should go with it or whether I should learn just enough to get by and focus my attention on SQL / PowerBI / Python etc instead. 

I know Google Scripts App use Javascript for Google Sheet manipulation - so the only real benefit I see would be if there is a huge shift from desktop sheets (Excel) to G-sheets which I doubt is going to happen. 

Are there any other benefits for Javascript or should I focus my attention elsewhere?

245,dataanalysis,"A client produces 6-12 spreadsheets each quarter.

They have an excel guru put together a big document that visualizes the data. The document contains things like bar charts and descriptive statistics.

I would like to prepare a dashboard application  that is hosted online or could be shared as a standalone application.

The application should be able to accept the data sets as input (ideally, with a drag-and-drop graphical interface), COMBINE the data sets behind the scenes, and produce the necessary data viz.

Goal is to automate the data viz process, and the mechanics should be straightforward since the data sets have the same structure from year to year.

CHALLENGES:

• The data sets are company sensitive. I cannot host a web application on any old web server. I need some contractual guarantee the data isn’t being spied on. My understanding is that most companies have freedom to intercept online info. Maybe then I don’t host the application online at all? An .html file could work.

• Client has restrictions on what kind of software they can install. I may be able to install PowerBI or Tableau on my system, but client may not be able.

• It would be nice to change the infrastructure so that the data is organized somewhere centralized but I don’t have control over that.

I am aware that Tableau can easily visualize data from multiple sources. I.e. it would be simple for ME to organize the spreadsheets, visualize key metrics, and host it online. What I would like is a freestanding application where the CLIENT drags and drops the spreadsheets and an application spits out some visuals.

Even though it looks like a spreadsheet,  it works like a database. This means you can not only run SQL queries on the spreadsheet but also scale it to thousands or millions of rows.

**Key differentiators**

1. You can write SQL queries on your spreadsheet. You can also do JOIN queries across spreadsheets.
2. API out of the box for your data so you can wire it to other systems.
3. Easily handle millions of rows - buttery smooth
4. Import your CSV or Excel files and run SQL queries over

**Upcoming features :**

1. Save SQL queries for future use
2. Native connection to the databases
3. Self hostable version

I'm in the process of building a fashion aggregation website as a portfolio piece. To obtain the data for this site, I have multiple scrapers for many of the largest fashion retailers in North America.

My question concerns table construction - my scrapers output every variant of every product with their associated data, which can be in CSV or pandas DataFrame format. Can any of you tell me how I would go about populating two database tables from this data:

1. Table with the parent product, with foreign keys to each of its variants

2. All variant products of a parent product, linked to that product such that on my eventual website, they can all be found through searching the foreign keys of the parent product. 

I hope that makes sense, in a bit of a jam here. I'm not sure what to Google - even if you can't provide an answer, any points on even what to research would be of great help.

I got an offer with a 40% increase in salary for a data analysis role. It's in the security domain and would involve a lot of regex, which I will learn on site. I know the basics but the role would turn me into a regex master I guess. A nice skill to have, I don't know how useful though.

So, in closing, another non-classic analyst role, but it again touches on language, which I like.

I feel  like I'm already in a niche market, and this role would keep me there. On the other hand, breaking into the more mainstream positions would be a bit tough because I've never looked at this kind of data. I don't know if it will interest me. So I'm asking for a bunch of stranger on the internet for advice!

Would you stay in this niche? Where I live I didn't see many NLP analyst jobs. I am a bit worries that I'm boxing myself in. Would appreciate your thoughts!

279,dataanalysis,"Hi everyone, I have an associate's degree in data science and have experience with Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and more. I am having troubles finding work as most of the positions over here are for more advanced degrees so I have a few questions...

1. What's the best way to network in this field? I've had a few interviews but they wanted someone with experience and I'm entry level.

2. How can I make myself stand out against my competitors and those with higher degrees? I can perform the job descriptions with ease. A degree is just a degree. I have independent experience and knowledge backing me up.

3. What are some certifications/licenses that would be especially helpful?

My school doesn't offer any data analytics classes within my major, currently, I'm in a marketing research class but it's very basic statistics that are all done with a program.

Recently I finished a digital marketing certification through Google. I was looking into data analytics certification (a sea of them), some are very expensive, my school offers a duo that would come out to over $4,000. While researching, the general consensus is that I should spend my time/money learning SQL, Phyton, Excel(pivot tables/VLookup) instead of a broad data analytics cert.

Does anybody have any advice? I think the best thing is experience but to gain that experience it looks like ill have to invest time into myself after class.

I'm hoping to have these in my back pocket so I can look for an internship which will have to be during my Senior year since I'm taking summer classes.

I moved to the states back in 2019. In EU, I was working in the iGaming industry as a Fraud Analyst but since I moved here, starting a new life on top of everything going on COVID and all, it's been a struggle to land a job. In the meantime, I recently started learning SQL by myself.

Although I have given some projects with HTML5, CSS3 and C# at collage, haven't used them since 2016, so it's a weakness. Now I am heavily considering to take [this course](https://www.pathstream.com/pages/continuing_nyu_tableau?utm_source=linkedin_pst_ta&utm_campaign=l1004_klik_pst_-_nyu_tableau_wv_tier-2_p_data-management-interests_c-s_-_-_-_no_ta_no_cpc_ty&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=klik_01-06-2021_refresh_learn_le6_nyu-logo&s=nyu&c=tableau&li_fat_id=75ffe19d-421c-466c-a21a-07e4e7816bd5) provided by the collaboration of NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Tableau and Pathstream. 

The context and the structure of the program is appealing to me, and I honestly believe it would give me a good understanding of the full picture of the industry and provide a good start. And I found it affordable and potentially worth for money. 

I wonder if anyone here took this course, because I wasn't able to find any feedbacks online from the people who might have taken this course earlier. It starts on May 11th, hope to get some insight before that date.

I also found SQL's syntax easy to pick up, but to me, the hardest part would be visualizing the data structure you'd like to work on.

290,dataanalysis,"We interviewed different people working in data engineering to talk about the future of the data analytics space. What was particularly interesting in this exercise was how differently those interviewed thought about the future of the space. We've ﻿heard everything from streaming to cataloging to monitoring as future areas that teams believe will become front and center over the next five years. Below are the top three takeaways we had from the interviews presented in the report.

**Specialization will grow within the data team**

Most data engineers and data analysts are wearing many hats today. This is because the investment into the data team has only recently increased. As the value of data teams becomes more evident and more investment is placed in this department, data teams will specialize to focus on a particular function. This could mean having a reliability data engineer, a visualization lead, and a separation between backend and frontend data engineering teams. We believe these kinds of organizational changes will begin to take shape over the next 5 years.

**The ""data gap"" between data producers and consumers will shrink**

As more investment is directed towards self-service analytics, the gap between data consumers and data producers will continue to shrink. Tools that help teams centralize an understanding of data will become mandatory across all data teams. We've solved storing data, and moving data, as well as visualizing data. When we look at the challenges that a team faces today, the idea of self-serve analytics and understanding is the next largest issue.

**Data will become a product**

More data teams will adopt practices that help them ﻿measure, manage and develop data like a product team. On the surface, this might mean a transition towards agile project management. At a more intricate level, this might mean transitioning towards data tools that enable cross-organization collaboration, version control, and monitoring. We believe that innovation in this area of data analytics will be interesting.

291,dataanalysis,"I have to work with several tables that have poorly or inconsistently named IDs, as well as no documentation to help determine what is what. 

Some things I've seen: 

* A table has ""id"" and ""idnumber"" fields and they are different numbers. 
* In a schema one table is ""thing"", the other is ""things"". Both have just ""id"" as the primary key
* A table has ""id"" and ""table\_id"" fields and they are different numbers. 

What are your opinions here? I prefer explicit naming and truly hate seeing ""id"" in any table. I've seen other discussions where it is preferred to use \`table.id\` syntax, as the table should tell you what the id is referencing. I think that's fine, except that sometimes the tables are also poorly named. Thoughts?"

Every year that passes, 5 senior residents leave and 5 new residents enter. The number of available cases varies every year and I have over a decade of those data as well. Lastly, when a resident achieves the required number, they continue to do those cases. However, they try to give them to others who don’t have enough and they’re less likely to perform them than their seniority cohorts who haven’t gotten their numbers yet.

The bot was built to look at all the coins on Binance and pick the most volatile ones in a given timeframe, in order to automatically buy the ones which are likely to keep increasing in price in the short-term at least.

Here's more detailed breakdown of the main configuration:

* The bot will listen to changes in price across all Coins on Binance paired to USDT
* By default Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs are excluded
* The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last minute
* The bot will buy 15 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
* The bot will sell at 2% profit or 2% stop loss

Now all these configurations above are customisable, you can input any values you like it you are interested in trying out a different strategy.

The dev community has contributed with some more major updates like:

* Trailing stop loss - the stop loss will move up and follow the price -2% (configurable), which essentially allows the bot to maximise the profit in a bull run, as long as it continues
* Better testing - the bot is able so simulate real-life trades and store the output in a file to determine whether your configuration is profitable.

The .close() method allows for us to unblock (and raise the Closed exception within) all threads waiting to get items from a queue once it is empty, after reaching a point where no more items are to be put into the queue. This will also prevent putting further items from being put into the queue, and instead will raise the Closed exception.

I am still publishing articles on that series, and, therefore, the book is still growing. I have had some nice feedback from the community (i.e., from people like you) but I'm looking for something more.

I would like you to give me your most honest feedback on everything related to the book, but especially about:
 - the book cover
 - the book description on the sites
 - the book font and overall layout
 - the content of the chapters

When giving feedback, feel free to say what/how you feel about X, Y, or Z, and, if possible, say what you would have done differently.
I appreciate that most people have different opinions regarding many different subjects and that is what I want: exposure to many different opinions.
Naturally, I will agree with some people and disagree with other people, but if your critique is honest and comes from a good place (even if it is a bad critique) it will be helpful because it will make me think about how I am doing things.

Hopefully, if enough people go through the trouble of giving some honest feedback, I might be able to spot major flaws on my work and fix them _while_ the book is still being written.

315,Python,"Hey Python-friends,

In the last couple of weeks I worked on a small side project combining Space Science and Machine Learning.

Background: As a former Solar System scientist I still like to work on astronomy topics in my free time. My main focus: Asteroids, Near-Earth Objects, Comets, Cosmic Dust and Meteors. So basically everything that is rocky or icy.

Asteroids appear like dots in a telescope. If they approach our planet quite close one can use radars to determine their size and shape quite well. The rest of the time scientists can ""only"" determine their brightness, indirectly their size, and orbit around the Sun (and other intrinsic parameters). That's it!

But one can also determine the spectrum of an asteroid: E.g., by determining the reflectance of the surface for different wavelengths. These reflectance spectra allow scientists to determine the composition of the object. In total, there are 4 ""main groups"":

* C: Carbonaceous Asteroid, most common in the Solar System with... well you guess it, carbon-like compositions
* S: ... like ""stony"" asteroids, silicates, minerals, etc. dominate the surface
* X: -class asteroids are mostly classified as ""iron"" asteroids (no these are not pure ""iron rocks"" but show a high abundance of iron, nickel, etc.
* Other: Outliers with rare or unique compositions

These main groups are the most common ones. Other classification systems by Bus et al., Tholen et al. and so on (I spare you with the details) introduce more classes and differentiate them to up to 20 classes and more.

Why am I telling you this? Well I was thinking: Bus et al. classified over 1200 spectra by hand (20 years ago). Why not testing Machine Learning algorithms on these data for classification purposes? And that's what I did. In the GitHub repo that is shown below, several Jupyter Notebooks are stored starting from fetching and parsing the data, to trainings of multi class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using scikit-learn.

Further, I programmed a small Feed-Forward and 1D Convolutional Neural Network using Keras to compress the spectra to a 2-dimensional space, to see whether ""spectra clusters"" appear that can be associated with these arbitrary classification schemas. Small videos of these clusters can be seen on my [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/MrAstroThomas/status/1393191707710271489); however these interactive plotting routines are all available in the corresponding scripts.

[The GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/sandbox/tree/main/asteroid_taxonomy)

*What is the long-term goal of this project and the ""sandbox projects"" in general?* In June I would like to show the results on a space science conference. Further, I am developing a Solar System Python library that focuses on Small Bodies (Asteroids, etc.) that could be used by students and also by myself for my Medium tutorials (and also future YT tutorials). I think that enthusiastic Python developers and free-time data scientists and citizen scientists could improve, support and boost the scientific community with great ideas and Open Source solutions.

I hope you all do well during these challenging times and find some calm moments for projects and your hobbies,

316,Python,"**What is it?**  
Reviews is a terminal UI Dashboard for monitoring requests for code review across several Github repositories and pull requests.   


**What does it look like?**

https://preview.redd.it/aa9i4yx1i9z61.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=55468a9cea99edff1a8c1c260ec776e8e2177280

**How to use it?**  


You can install it directly from PyPi and configure it to use and provide your configuration like so

`pip install reviews`  


The following is example configuration for the TUI:

`export GITHUB_TOKEN=""your-token-here""`  
`export GITHUB_USER=""apoclyps""`  
`export REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION=""apoclyps/micropython-by-example,apoclyps/reviews,apoclyps/magic-home,datadog/dd-trace-py""`  


Once configured you can run it from your terminal using:

`reviews dashboard --no-reload`  


**How to get involved?**

The code is available on Github [https://github.com/apoclyps/reviews](https://github.com/apoclyps/reviews) and there is a small video demo on the repository. You can install and use it from PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/reviews/](https://pypi.org/project/reviews/)

I've also created a number of an issue for first-time contributors, but I'm open to anyone creating a feature request for anything they would like to add. I'm always happy to receive feedback to improve reviews.

326,Python,"A while ago, I posted here about [pyHanko's 0.1.0 release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kn1alp/pyhanko_pdf_signatures_in_python/). Since then, pyHanko has matured quite a bit, both in terms of new features and general robustness; see the [long list of changes](https://pyhanko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html) in the documentation. We're not quite ready for a `1.0.0` release yet, but I believe that that's not too far off now. [Feedback](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko/issues) from the community has been extremely valuable in the development process, so thanks to all of you who filed issues!

[PyHanko](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko) is a Python PDF signing library released under the MIT license, with the ultimate (and rather ambitious) goal to cover all digital signing features of the PDF standard as completely as possible, while at the same time offering a fairly simple CLI to perform basic signing and validation tasks.
It functions both as a Python library for handling common signing & validation tasks, and as a command-line tool. The CLI was built using [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click), so it comes with a built-in help function.

Here are some of the things that changed between version 0.1.0 and 0.6.0:

 * RSASSA-PSS support.
 * Support all document encryption schemes in PDF 2.0.
 * Major improvements to the PKCS#11 integration.
 * Greatly improved incremental update analysis for validating documents with multiple signatures.
 * Better support for remote signing services (""some assembly required"", as they say: you still have to write some integration code yourself)
 * [Certomancer](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/certomancer) for automated PKI testing (this doesn't affect you as a user, but it has definitely made iterating on test code a whole lot easier).
 * Migrated to [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) as the main crypto dependency; [oscrypto](https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto) is still used as a back-up for some legacy corner cases.
 * Tons and tons of bug fixes & minor enhancements.

See [the GitHub readme](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko) for a brief overview of the feature set. More documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://pyhanko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The documentation covers both the library and the CLI.

Releases are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko/releases) and on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyHanko/)."

## General Info for ML Model of Predicting TUPRS.IS Stock Prices

[TUPRS-IS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TUPRS.IS?p=TUPRS.IS&.tsrc=fin-srch) is a stock that you can buy globally, belongs to TUPRAS Turkiye Petroleum Refineries which is one of the biggest companies in Turkey with the market cap around 24,5 B.

[TUPRS.IS Stock Overview](https://preview.redd.it/1wwtcf1a13z61.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c17f66ad725302ab6ce328c61c372f5d1988b72)

This machine learning model is created for observing the effects of following criterias on TUPRS.IS stock market price;

* TUPRS.IS Stock Market Volume
* [Crude Oil Prices in USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CL=F?p=CL=F&.tsrc=fin-srch)
* Crude Oil Volume
* [USD/EUR Currency Rate](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EUR=X?p=EUR=X&.tsrc=fin-srch)
* [USD/TRY Currency Rate](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRY=X?p=TRY=X&.tsrc=fin-srch)
* [Turkish Monthly Inflation Rates](https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/Statistics/Inflation+Data)

Since it is a Turkish company, USD/TRY currency is also evaluated along with the inflation rates.

All data provided for the model is scraped through web, and features are pre-processed within the script I wrote. You can directly copy the script and run if you have necessary libraries.

For Yahoo Finance scraping, I've used a class written in [Stack Overflow by Mike-D](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44225771/scraping-historical-data-from-yahoo-finance-with-python). Yahoo Finance provides the historical data in infinite scrolling format. It is really hard to scrape through with classical BS4 and lxml.

## Machine Learning Model and Predictions for Different Variables

Since the data frame is really complicated, and as you know stock values actually depends on millions of stuff. I've chosen to use poly features in my model. Also after using poly features, values are scaled using StandardScaler for fast computation(almost 20 times faster).

https://preview.redd.it/y068jnpu13z61.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=da683ba062d2c0d07114703ffc56a69cee08c48f

### Elastic Net Regularization

[With train\_test\_split, 10&#37; of the data is chosen for final test and models were created to find best \\""alpha\\"" for Lambda in the ElasticNet equation above and \\""l1\_ratio\\"" which is the alpha which arranges the weight of LASSO and Ridge Regressions.](https://preview.redd.it/e5csgr7y13z61.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=71e5de9802300613767768baf99309bcb00c929f)

After fitting the model to training set, RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE(Mean Absolute Error) are calculated accordingly. 

https://preview.redd.it/ahpxsz4123z61.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=e007752cdf0c638f79ab011d137ac29109885b3a

Values were not suprising for the model; ElasticNet(alpha=0.01, l1\_ratio=1, max\_iter=100000). Basically saying LASSO Regression was way better than using Ridge.

The final results with std. scaler + poly\_features; #Root Mean Squared Error: 8.89, Mean Absolute Error: 6.91 with standard scaling. #Root Mean Squared Error: 8.97, Mean Absolute Error: 7.04 without std. scaling.

### In short; our ML model is working around 7-10% error for predicting TUPRS.IS stock prices depending on other parameters. BTW, we should definitely not put any money based on this model which has 7-10% error. It would be really naive.

As a quick note; I've also tried ElasticNetCV, LASSO and Ridge Regressions on the dataframe with different scaling options. RMSE.mean() were around 25%, way too high; so I've continued with GridSearchCV + ElasticNet which is around 10%, seemed nice.

## Effects of Other Variables on Stock Prices

We created our model with an acceptable error(accepted by me), let's find out what variables are affecting the stock prices. These graphs are created by keeping all parameters stable and only changing one in order to observe clear effects.

**This is where we will have really interesting information about the effects of other parameters on stock prices.**

### Crude Oil Price [USD]

Interesting observation; it has a peak and optimum value around 75 USD but converging down for too high and too low. 

&#x200B;

### TUPRS.IS Stock and Crude Oil Volume in Stock Market

Both volume increases have linear effect on stock prices. For Tüpraş volume, it is easy to guess; if it's bought more, it will increase. However, for the crude oil volume it didn't make sense to me. Maybe someone who knows can explain better.

### TRY Inflation Rate

Inflation rate has positive effect on stock prices. However, as you may guess inflation also means value loss on currency(in this case TRY). So this parameter actually should be deeply analysed by someone who can understand finance.

### USD/TRY Currency

This is where it gets really interesting. TUPRS.IS stock values actually really dependent on USD/TRY currency and according to our model it has an optimum value around 1 USD = 5.5 TRY. **If USD/TRY goes above 11 TRY, TUPRS.IS stocks losing all of its value and becomes 0 TRY directly. (maybe not possible in real world, but can say something for the future if USD/TRY goes up like that.)**

### USD/EUR Currency

This graph actually explains what happens if USD loses or earns money compared to EUR. According to our ML model, it has the lowest stock price value around 0.7. If USD earns more value and goes up to 0.9, TUPRS.IS also increases it's price. But same situation also goes on for the complete opposite scenario. I didn't find this graph meaningful, but added anyways.

In conclusion, stock prices depends on millions of parameters. Maybe it can be modeled up to some degree, but in real world it is almost impossible to come up with a future value just like that.

I made a mini framework in Python that makes it easy to create state machines: [StateEngine](https://github.com/aymanimtyaz/StateEngine)

Anyone who has used Flask before will find it very easy to use. State handlers are assigned to states in the same way routes are assigned to view functions in Flask.

I was working on a project earlier that included building a conversational chatbot. The code I'd written for the chatbot's logic was very convoluted and confusing, with if-else statements nested 6 levels in some cases before I decided to use a state machine and the framework that I created. 

Using StateEngine. I was able to refactor the entire code base in an hour and in vastly fewer lines of code.

349,Python,"Antivirus programs detect viruses by generating a hash of a file and comparing them with one of the hashes already known to the antivirus. If the image generates the same has as the virus it should flag the image as a virus. This would be possible since an image or file goes from a high entropy state to a lower one. Of course, anti-virus software uses multiple ways to create signatures of a single file. But maybe this script could generate some false positives.

I'm not sure if this could work, since I have no success yet. But in theory, this should be possible.

The main purpose of this was to compare the speed between PyPy & the normal python interpreter. This was done by adding a logging line to the infinite while loop. After a while running the script in PyPy you see a considerable speed-up in generation speed.

I would love to hear suggestions or things I should consider to improve this script & if it is even possible.

Hi,

This is a cool project of controlling Atari 2600 Pole position race game using the hands.

The hands “creates” an invisible virtual car wheel that controls the race game. Very cool

The project is based on Python, OpenCV , and Mediapipe

The goal is to create a functionality that replaces the traditional Atari paddle with our hands pose

The code estimate the position of each hands , and calculate the X,Y axis to simulate Left and Right directions ,

That transforms to an action keyboard keys

I added a link for the code in the video description, so you can download and enjoy

There is step by step tutorial how can we detect the hands and extract a specific landmarks in the video description.

If you would like that I would produce a specific video tutorial for this cool demo , please comment the Youtube video. If there will be a demand , I will create one.

You are most welcome to subscribe for more videos to come

353,Python,"Hi everybody

This post is halfway between a flare and a cry for help

I started coding in Python 5 years ago, after leaving the academic world were I was proficient with MATLAB and I discovered that the industry world is not too happy of paying thousands of euros every year for the licences. Since then I become quite proficient with python up to the point that I think I can call myself an expert.

However one thing in python always made me cry: plotting.

As an engineering consultant, half of the times I handle calculations were the outputs are hundreds or thousands of numbers (just think to the result of the structural analysis of a building), so to present the results - and perform visual checks - visualizing the data is a fundamental part of the job.

I'm quite sure that if you ask to 100 python developers which library is the most ""standard"" plotting library in python, 99 of them will answer **matplotlib**.

However, in 2021, the limitations of matplotlib are absolutely stunning (considering it's ""standard"" status). Just to list a fews:

* you can't (easily) select data from a plot, reimport the data into python, modify them or delete them
* you can't (easily) copy-paste plots from one axis to another
* you can't (easily) save a figure to be opened interactively again (yes, you can pickle them, but you can't do it from the plot interface and there are very little mentions to this in the documentation just to confirm that this is not ""readily available"")
* now - last but not least - **I just discovered that if you use a 3d plot you can't zoom!!**

I tried other packages such as plotly or bokeh. On one side they are much more versatile, on the other they are way more complicated, requiring tens of rows to perform the most basic plots.

Is it possible that in 2021 python is still lacking a real interactive and easy to use library; at least on the same level of MATLAB's regarding ease of use and features?

What do you usually use to visualize your data? Do you have any suggestion?"
